# Restaurant Page

A simple website where you can buy different types of organic tea. This website is part of The Odin Project. 

It was built with CSS, JavaScript, and Webpack. 

The focus of this project was to get familiar with modules, webpack as well as to keep practicing DOM manipulation. 

Every page is inside a separate module. Every element, except the navigation bar, is created using JavaScript only.
